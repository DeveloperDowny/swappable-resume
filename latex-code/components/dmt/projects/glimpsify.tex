\item Built a tool to identify key frames in educational YouTube videos and generate PDF notes from those frames for easy and quick reference/revision.
\item The system captures text at regular intervals throughout the video. It analyzes each frame using OCR technology, creating a timeline of extracted text with precise timestamps. By applying multiple analysis strategies to this text timeline, the system identifies the key frames in the video.
\item Analyzed text timelines using \textbf{NumPy}, \textbf{SciPy} and \textbf{pandas}, then created visualizations with \textbf{Matplotlib}. These tools helped discover patterns and trends that shaped the key frame extraction algorithms.
\item Used \textbf{LangGraph} to chat with the extracted text, allowing users to ask questions about the video content and receive relevant answers based on the key frames.
\item Used \textbf{Google Cloud Storage} for storing the generated PDFs, \textbf{Google Cloud Run} for deploying a \textbf{Telegram bot} and key frame extraction service, \textbf{Google Pub/Sub} for managing the communication between the bot and the PDF generation, storage and delivery services.
